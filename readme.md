# Resolution Changer
## Two versions, one in Python and one in Go  
I've added change of DPI since I'm using 2560x1440 in 125% scale. Also a way to listen to my monitor as microphone for PS5 audio.


For python code run:

`pyinstaller resolution_changer.spec`

For Go code run:

`go build -ldflags "-H=windowsgui"`

Might add builtin option to run on startup
